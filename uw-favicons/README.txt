UW Favicons

In the past, a website or web application included a favicon.ico file in its document root that Web browsers would use to show in browser tabs or bookmarks.

Nowadays, modern browsers and operating systems have varying ways of specifying an icon that visually represents a website or app that has been bookmarked or added to a mobile device's home screen or saved to a Windows laptop tile.

This zip file contains the sample markup and files you need to use the official UW crest logo as your site's favicon in all of these different contexts. The files were generated using https://realfavicongenerator.net and follow common best practices.

To use the favicons, save the *images* folder and the *browserconfig.xml*, *favicon.ico*, and *site.webmanifest* files in your siteâ€™s code. Copy the markup between the *BEGIN FAVICONS* and *END FAVICONS* comments in the *example.html* file into your project's HTML files or templates. If you save the various files or images directory in different locations, you'll need to edit the markup and paths within *browserconfig.xml* and *site.webmanfiest* accordingly.

**Note:** This favicon set is built into the campus Wordpress theme <i>UW Theme</i>.
